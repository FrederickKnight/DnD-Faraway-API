## Notes

### Lucia Auth

Added Lucia Auth session handler from the documentation "["Lucia Auth Basic API"](https://lucia-next.pages.dev/sessions/basic-api/)" in the routes and controllers of this API.
This is because I wanted to learn handling session so I refactor them in python flask, but this also needs handling in the frontent of my web for this API.
